## Adding a New Project

Edit `src/data/projects.ts` and add a new entry following the existing shape (title, category, year, description, details, techStack, githubLink, liveLink, isStudentProject).

## Customization

Site-wide text (name, title, intro, availability, contact links) lives in `src/data/site.ts` — update this file to change hero content without touching component code.

Color palette and spacing tokens are defined as CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` under `:root`, making theme adjustments centralized and consistent across all sections.
